- [ ] Add beginTime -> endTime in movement alerts for like $1000

- [ ] Save queues into csv so they can be reloaded

- [x] Streaks should be tracked both directions and mention the current price and percentage change

- [x] Basic graphs

- [ ] Disable Discord notifications/parsing via hostname? Something like `!toggle <hostname>`

- [ ] Maybe there should be thresholds that have messages get sent out but then we have addl. thresholds for alerts that hit @everyone

- [ ] Alert when streak is over

## Scratch

Config file should have different event descriptions for each currency instead of 3 generic ones
